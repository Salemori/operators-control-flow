    * ```*``` Multiplication
    * ```/``` Division
    * ```%``` Modulus
    * ```**```Exponentiation
    * ```++``` Increment
    * ```--``` Decrement

* Assignment Operators:
    * Assignmet operator: ```=``` 
    * Arithmetic Assignment Operator:     
    ```+=``` ```-=``` ```*=``` ```/=``` ```%=``` ```**=```
    * Logical Assignment Operators:
    ```&&=``` ```||=``` ```??=```
    * Bitwise Assignment Operators:
    ```&=``` ```^=``` ```|=```
    * Shift Assignment Operators:
    ```<<=```  ```>>=``` ```>>>=```

* Comparison Operators:
    * ```>``` greater than
    * ```<``` less than
    * ```>=``` greater than or equal to
    * ```<=``` less than or equal to
    * ```==``` equal to
    * ```===``` equal value and equal type (strict equal to)
    * ```!=``` not equal
    * ```!==``` not equal value or not equal type (strict not equal to)

* Logical Operators:
    * ```&&``` and
    * ```||``` or
    * ```!``` not

* Bitwise Operators:
    * ```&``` AND
    * ```|``` OR
    * ```^``` XOR
    * ```~``` NOT
    * ```<<```  Zero fill left shift
    * ```>>``` Signed right shift
    * ```>>>``` Zero fill right shift

### Answer_2
-[x] Examples of:
* Arithmetic Operators:
    ```14 / 7;``` result is 2.
    ```19 % 2;``` result is 1.
* Assignment Operators: 
    * ```age = 15;``` variable age is assigned the value 15.
    * ```age *= 2;``` evaluates to 30 as age is assigned the value 15 above.
* Comparison Operators: 
    * ```2 <= 8;``` evaluates to true.
    * ```10 > 20;``` evaluates to false.
*  Logical Operators:
    * ```10 >= 9 && 4 === 4;``` output true.
    * ```"3" === 3 || 20 <= 15;``` output false.
* Bitwise Operators:
    * ```8 << 1;``` output 16.
    * ```4 >> 1;``` output 2.

### Answer_4
-[x] Code:
```for(let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7) /
{ /
    console.log(i); /
}``` 
- Output:
```1```
```8``
```15```
